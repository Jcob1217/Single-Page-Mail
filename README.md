# Single-Page-Mail

The Simple Email Client project aims to create a basic email client using JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS. 
The objective was to develop an interface that allows users to send, receive, and manage emails efficiently.

With this email client, users will be able to compose and send emails easily. 
They can enter the recipient's email address, write the message, and click send to deliver the email.

The client will also provide a convenient way for users to view and reply to their received emails. 
They can navigate through their inbox, read the messages, and manage their email history.
